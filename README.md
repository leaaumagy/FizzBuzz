# FizzBuzz Project

This project contains implementations of the FizzBuzz algorithm in Python and JavaScript (Node.js). The goal is to demonstrate the solution to the FizzBuzz problem in two different programming languages.

## Description

Display numbers between **1** and **N** by following the rules:
- if number can be divided by 3: display **Fizz** ;
- if number can be divided by 5: display **Buzz** ;
- if number can be divided by 3 **AND** 5 : display **FizzBuzz** ;
- else: display the number.

This project includes solutions for this problem in both Python and JavaScript (Node.js).

## Prerequisites

- **Python** for running the Python script.
- **Node.js** for running the JavaScript script.
