# FizzBuzz Project

This project contains implementations of the FizzBuzz algorithm in Python and JavaScript (Node.js). The goal is to demonstrate the solution to the FizzBuzz problem in two different programming languages.

## Description

The FizzBuzz problem is a classic programming exercise that asks you to print the numbers from 1 to 100, with the following conditions:
- Print "Fizz" for multiples of 3.
- Print "Buzz" for multiples of 5.
- Print "FizzBuzz" for multiples of 15.
- Print the number itself for all other cases.

This project includes solutions for this problem in both Python and JavaScript (Node.js).

## Prerequisites

- **Python** for running the Python script.
- **Node.js** for running the JavaScript script.
